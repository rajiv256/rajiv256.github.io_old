 <p>Hey there! This is Rajiv. I am a budding Computer Scientist and an Open Source enthusiast. Recently I finished my undergraduation from IIT Madras, in Computer Science and Engg.., The four years I spent there nurtured my interest towards the field, and all the time I have been waiting for a chance to do something new, something cool and something beautiful. Although, I was unable to do much except doing assignments during my four year stay, I created space to try something new whenever I got time. As a result, I gained experience with OOPS, Python Scripting, Plugins for Google Chrome, NodeJS web-applications to name a few. All this wouldn't have been possible if there wasn't ready made code available on Stack Overflow, online blogs etc.., These resources were great places for learning and especially are free. This made me love Open source more and this teensy blog is my drop-in-an-ocean effort to give it back to the world of Open Source. </p>


 <p>I don't know, what I will do in my life. I am still < 25 and I am figuring out what to do. My goals keep on changing from time to time. One day I want to build a Robot from scratch and next day I will be reading about writing an Online multiplayer game. I can't really choose one. Its tough making choices.</p>

 <p>As for my interests, they too are varied. I like Robotics, Systems Programming, App Dev, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences. I dunno why but Quantum physics fascinates me very much. Apart from these I enjoy ocassional fiction novel, story writing and comics. </p>
