One of the math concepts that continue to confound me are that of the *supremum* and *infimum*. Why do we have to complicate math discourse when we have the conventional *maxima* and *minima* that have been adsorbed into the minds of every high schooler ever. Is it because mathematicians are inherently elitist, egotistical, painfully do-hard blue-bloods? Well, yes and no.
