<h3> Short Bio </h3>

<p>Greetings, ethical stalker. This is Rajiv (27 earth years later), a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Duke University. I received my undergrad in CS from IIT-Madras. For the first two years, I suffered painfully to keep up with my academics. However, discovering <a href="https://github.com/rajiv256/competitive-programming"/>competitive programming</a> and working on writing a <a href="https://github.com/rajiv256/Chess"/>Chess engine </a> kinda revived my interest in CS. Subsequently, in the final two years I was fortunate enough to work with <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/">Prof. Chester Rebeiro</a> for developing a <a href="https://rajiv256.github.io/projects/ouros/"/>Web server from scratch</a> using Rust, and with <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sutanuc/">Prof. Sutanu Chakraborty</a> in writing <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71928-3_27"/>this paper</a> (which made me realize--Golly molly, maybe I could do research!). After that, I worked under the supervision of <a href="talukdar.net">Prof. Partha Talukdar</a>, in a budding ML startup, kenome.io, and at Google Research. After that, with an ample amount of mental jujitsu, self-doubt, and self-questioning, I landed in Duke's Ph.D. program. Here, I work with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/"/>Prof. John Reif </a> in the field of <a href="https://www.dna.caltech.edu/DNAresearch_perspective.html"/>Natural Computing</a>. In my free time, I like to read and indulge in sports or cinema. I am also an intermediate level Chess player, slowly trying to improve. I like talking to people, come say hi! </p>
