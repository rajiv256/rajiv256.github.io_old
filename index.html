<h3> Short Bio </h3>
<p> Good tidings! This is Rajiv, a PhD student in the CompSci department at Duke. Here, I work with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/">Prof. John Reif</a> in the field of Natural Computing (<a href="https://www.dna.caltech.edu/DNAresearch_perspective.html">huh?</a>). Some sane people refer to this field as DNA Computing, as we use synthetic DNA oligonucleotides to perform various computations in the chemical medium. I like Chess, Badminton, Reading, and Watching movies. </p>
