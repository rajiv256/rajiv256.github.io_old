<h3> Short Bio </h3>

<p>I am an incoming graduate student in the Computer Science department at Duke University, starting Fall '21. I received my undergrad degree from the CS department of IIT-M in 2017. Here, I worked under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/">Prof. Chester Rebeiro</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sutanuc/">Prof. Sutanu Chakraborty</a>. Afterwards, I was fortunate to work with <a href="talukdar.net">Prof. Partha Talukdar</a>, in a budding ML startup, kenome.io, as well as at Google Research. In my free time, I like to indulge myself in sports or cinema. I am also an intermediate level Chess player, and am slowly trying to improve. I like talking to people, come say hi! </p>
