  abstract = "To construct sophisticated biochemical circuits from scratch, one
              needs to understand how simple the building blocks can be and how
              robustly such circuits can scale up. Using a simple DNA reaction
              mechanism based on a reversible strand displacement process, we
              experimentally demonstrated several digital logic circuits,
              culminating in a four-bit square-root circuit that comprises 130
              DNA strands. These multilayer circuits include thresholding and
              catalysis within every logical operation to perform digital
              signal restoration, which enables fast and reliable function in
              large circuits with roughly constant switching time and linear
              signal propagation delays. The design naturally incorporates
              other crucial elements for large-scale circuitry, such as general
              debugging tools, parallel circuit preparation, and an abstraction
              hierarchy supported by an automated circuit compiler.",
