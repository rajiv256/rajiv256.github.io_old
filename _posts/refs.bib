  abstract = "To construct sophisticated biochemical circuits from scratch, one
              needs to understand how simple the building blocks can be and how
              robustly such circuits can scale up. Using a simple DNA reaction
              mechanism based on a reversible strand displacement process, we
              experimentally demonstrated several digital logic circuits,
              culminating in a four-bit square-root circuit that comprises 130
              DNA strands. These multilayer circuits include thresholding and
              catalysis within every logical operation to perform digital
              signal restoration, which enables fast and reliable function in
              large circuits with roughly constant switching time and linear
              signal propagation delays. The design naturally incorporates
              other crucial elements for large-scale circuitry, such as general
              debugging tools, parallel circuit preparation, and an abstraction
              hierarchy supported by an automated circuit compiler.",

    construction of biochemical circuits and systems, because it is
    simple enough that its interactions can be rationally designed
    using Watson-Crick base pairing rules, yet the design space is
    remarkably rich. When designing DNA systems, this simplicity
    permits using functional sections of each strand, called domains,
    without considering particular nucleotide sequences. However, the
    actual sequences used may have interactions not predicted at the
    domain-level abstraction, and new rigorous analysis techniques
    are needed to determine the extent to which the chosen sequences
    conform to the system's domain-level description. We have
    developed a computational method for verifying sequence-level
    systems by identifying discrepancies between the domain-level and
    sequence-level behaviour. This method takes a DNA system, as
    specified using the domain-level tool Peppercorn, and analyses
    data from the stochastic sequence-level simulator Multistrand and
    sequence-level thermodynamic analysis tool NUPACK to estimate
    important aspects of the system, such as reaction rate constants
    and secondary structure formation. These techniques, implemented
    as the Python package KinDA, will allow researchers to predict
    the kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour of domain-level systems

    programmable DNA systems. Here, we build on prior practice to
    provide a new formalization of 'domain-level' representations of
    DNA strand displacement systems that has a natural connection to
    nucleic acid biophysics while still being suitable for formal
    analysis. Enumeration of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions
    provides a semantics for programmable molecular interactions,

    abstract = "DNA strand displacement circuits are powerful tools that can be
    rationally engineered to implement molecular computing tasks
    because they are programmable, cheap, robust, and predictable. A
    key feature of these circuits is the use of catalytic gates to
    amplify signal. Catalytic gates tend to leak; that is, they
    generate output signal even in the absence of intended input.
    Leaks are harmful to the performance and correct operation of DNA
    strand displacement circuits. Here, we present ``shadow
    cancellation'', a general-purpose technique to mitigate leak in
    catalytic DNA strand displacement circuits. Shadow cancellation
    involves constructing a parallel shadow circuit that mimics the
    primary circuit and has the same leak characteristics. It is
    situated in the same test tube as the primary circuit and
    produces ``anti-background'' DNA strands that cancel
    ``background'' DNA strands produced by leak. We demonstrate the
    feasibility and strength of the shadow leak cancellation approach
    through a challenging test case, a cross-catalytic feedback DNA
    amplifier circuit that leaks prodigiously. Shadow cancellation
    dramatically reduced the leak of this circuit and improved the
    signal-to-background difference by several fold. Unlike existing
    techniques, it makes no modifications to the underlying amplifier
    circuit and is agnostic to its leak mechanism. Shadow
    cancellation also showed good robustness to concentration errors
    in multiple scenarios. This work introduces a direction in leak
    reduction techniques for DNA strand displacement amplifier
    circuits and can potentially be extended to other molecular

    abstract = "The formation of a duplex between two nucleic acid strands is
    restricted if one of the strands forms an intra- or
    intermolecular secondary structure. The formation of the new
    duplex requires the dissociation and replacement of the initial
    structure. To understand the mechanism of this type of kinetics
    we studied the replacement of a labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe
    bound to a complementary DNA target with an unlabeled probe of
    the same sequence. The replacement kinetics were measured using a
    gel-shift assay for 12, 14 and 16-nucleotide probes as a function
    of temperature and concentration of the unlabeled probe. The
    results demonstrate that the overall replacement rate is a
    combination of two kinetic pathways: dissociative and sequential
    displacement. The dissociative pathway occurs by the spontaneous
    dissociation of the initial duplex followed by association of the
    target and unlabeled probe. The sequential displacement pathway
    requires only the partial melting of the initial duplex to allow
    for the formation of a branched nucleation complex with the

    used to implement a broad range of computational circuits at the
    nanoscale, with potential applications in high-precision
    biosensing, diagnostics, and therapeutics. However, nucleic acid
    circuits are prone to leaks, which result from unintended
    displacement interactions between nucleic acid strands. Such
    leaks can grow combinatorially with circuit size, are challenging
    to mitigate, and can significantly compromise circuit behavior.
    While several techniques have been proposed to partially mitigate
    leaks, computational methods for designing new leak mitigation
    strategies and comparing their effectiveness on circuit behavior
    are limited. Here we present a general method for the automated
    leak analysis of nucleic acid circuits, referred to as DSD Leaks.
    Our method extends the logic programming functionality of the
    Visual DSD language, developed for the design and analysis of
    nucleic acid circuits, with predicates for leak generation, a
    leak reaction enumeration algorithm, and predicates to exclude
    low probability leak reactions. We use our method to identify the
    critical leak reactions affecting the performance of control
    circuits, and to analyze leak mitigation strategies by
    automatically generating leak reactions. Finally, we design new
    control circuits with substantially reduced leakage including a
    sophisticated proportional-integral controller circuit, which can
    in turn serve as building blocks for future circuits. By
    integrating our method within an open-source nucleic acid circuit

    The addition of a DNA (or RNA) input strand displaces a signal
    strand from the sender gate, which can then transfer to the
    receiver gate. The performance of the cascade is found to vary
    strongly with the distance between the gates. A cascade with an
    intermediate gate distance of $\approx$20 nm exhibits faster
    kinetics than those with larger distances, whereas a cascade with
    smaller distance is corrupted by excessive intraorigami leak

    two gold electrodes (E-1 and E-2) with different DNA probes
    (S1/S2 hybrid probe in E-1 and DNA fuel strand S3 in E-2). In
    the presence of Kana, an S1/S2 probe can be disassembled from

    react with S3 on E-2 to form S2/S3 hybrid and release Kana
    through TMSDR. After then, the target recycling was triggered.
    Subsequently, the formed S2/S3 hybrid can also trigger a

    controller, leading to enhanced transient performances in
    comparison with a classical integral loop. Such a biomolecular

    Escherichia coli through the transporter AmtB. The P II
    molecules, which reflect the nitrogen status of the cell, inhibit
    both the production of AmtB and its activity (via the NtrB-NtrC
    system and the formation of a complex with GlnK, respectively).
    Other examples of LA-PI controller include copper and zinc

    decision-making in primate brains and collective decision-making
    in social insect colonies: in both systems, separate populations
    accumulate evidence for alternative choices; when one population
    reaches a threshold, a decision is made for the corresponding

    between the speed and the accuracy of decision-making. In

    applications such as in chemically amplified photoresists, to
    autocatalysis playing a fundamental role in evolution as well as
    a plausible key role in the origin of life. The phenomenon of
    autocatalysis is characterized by its kinetic signature rather
    than by its mechanistic aspects. The molecules that form
    autocatalytic systems and the mechanisms underlying
    autocatalytic reactions are very diverse. This chemical
    diversity, combined with the strong involvement of chemical
    kinetics, creates a formidable barrier for entrance to the
    field. Understanding these challenges, we wrote this Review with
    three main goals in mind: (i) To provide a basic introduction to
    the kinetics of autocatalytic systems and its relation to the
    role of autocatalysis in evolution, (ii) To provide a
    comprehensive overview, including tables, of synthetic chemical
    autocatalytic systems, and (iii) To provide an in-depth analysis

    abstract  = "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders with
    lifelong high blood sugar levels. Patients with diabetes must
    give themselves shots of insulin and/or other medication every
    day, usually accompanying poor blood sugar control and patient
    compliance. To meet this important challenge, we propose a
    noninsulin and drug-free strategy for long-acting regulation of
    blood sugar levels using a glycopolymersome that can reversibly
    sop up and squeeze out glucose in the blood stream. This
    glycopolymersome is self-assembled using a sugar and
    phenylboronic acid derivative-containing copolymer,
    poly(ethylene
    oxide)-block-poly[(7-(2-methacryloyloxyethoxy)-4-methylcoumarin)-stat-3-acrylamidophenylboronic
    acid-stat-N-acryloyl glucosamine]
    [PEO-b-P(CMA-stat-AAPBA-stat-AGA)]. As its AAPBA moiety
    dynamically binds to its glucosyl moiety and glucose in the
    blood stream, this glycopolymersome can function as a glucose
    storage device by reversibly substituting sugar: AAPBA actively
    tucks away extra glucose, releasing it gradually as the body
    needs it. Accordingly, it swells or shrinks in size at high/low
    glucose levels. In vitro, the critical glucose concentration for
    the handover between the uptake and the release is around 100 mg
    dLâ1, which matches with normal human blood sugar levels
    (70--110 mg dLâ1). In vivo, this displays excellent long-acting
    antidiabetic effects towards type 2 diabetic mice within 30 h
    upon one shot, showing no side effects. Overall, this
    `controlling sugar with sugar' concept holds promise for
    designing a range of new nanosized devices to regulate blood
    sugar levels without medication.",

              Networks",
  author   = "Lakin, Matthew R and Stefanovic, Darko",
  abstract = "The development of engineered biochemical circuits that exhibit
              adaptive behavior is a key goal of synthetic biology and
              molecular computing. Such circuits could be used for long-term
              monitoring and control of biochemical systems, for instance, to
              prevent disease or to enable the development of artificial life.
              In this article, we present a framework for developing adaptive
              molecular circuits using buffered DNA strand displacement
              networks, which extend existing DNA strand displacement circuit
              architectures to enable straightforward storage and modification
              of behavioral parameters. As a proof of concept, we use this
              framework to design and simulate a DNA circuit for supervised
              learning of a class of linear functions by stochastic gradient
              descent. This work highlights the potential of buffered DNA
              strand displacement as a powerful circuit architecture for
              implementing adaptive molecular systems.",

  title     = "Scaling up molecular pattern recognition with {DNA-based}
               winner-take-all neural networks",
  author    = "Cherry, Kevin M and Qian, Lulu",
  abstract  = "From bacteria following simple chemical gradients1 to the brain
               distinguishing complex odour information2, the ability to
               recognize molecular patterns is essential for biological
               organisms. This type of information-processing function has been
               implemented using DNA-based neural networks3, but has been
               limited to the recognition of a set of no more than four
               patterns, each composed of four distinct DNA molecules.
               Winner-take-all computation4 has been suggested5,6 as a
               potential strategy for enhancing the capability of DNA-based
               neural networks. Compared to the linear-threshold circuits7 and
               Hopfield networks8 used previously3, winner-take-all circuits
               are computationally more powerful4, allow simpler molecular
               implementation and are not constrained by the number of patterns
               and their complexity, so both a large number of simple patterns
               and a small number of complex patterns can be recognized. Here
               we report a systematic implementation of winner-take-all neural
               networks based on DNA-strand-displacement9,10 reactions. We use
               a previously developed seesaw DNA gate motif3,11,12, extended to
               include a simple and robust component that facilitates the
               cooperative hybridization13 that is involved in the process of
               selecting a `winner'. We show that with this extended seesaw
               motif DNA-based neural networks can classify patterns into up to
               nine categories. Each of these patterns consists of 20 distinct
               DNA molecules chosen from the set of 100 that represents the 100
               bits in 10 $\times$ 10 patterns, with the 20 DNA molecules
               selected tracing one of the handwritten digits `1' to `9'. The
               network successfully classified test patterns with up to 30 of
               the 100 bits flipped relative to the digit patterns `remembered'
               during training, suggesting that molecular circuits can robustly
               accomplish the sophisticated task of classifying highly complex
               and noisy information on the basis of similarity to a memory.
               DNA-strand-displacement reactions are used to implement a neural
               network that can distinguish complex and noisy molecular
               patterns from a set of nine possibilities---an improvement on
               previous demonstrations that distinguished only four simple
               patterns.",

              via the marginals of stationary distributions for various classes

              class of detailed balanced networks and prove that they can
              approximate any discrete distribution to any desired accuracy.
              However, these detailed balanced constructions rely on the
              ability to initialize a system precisely, and are therefore
              susceptible to perturbations in the initial conditions. We
              therefore provide another construction based on the ability to
              approximate point mass distributions and prove that this
              construction is capable of approximating arbitrary discrete
              distributions for any choice of initial condition. In particular,
              the developed models are ergodic, so their limit distributions

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

              single-stranded DNA molecules with catalytic capabilities.
              DNAzymes are generated de novo by in vitro selection--a powerful
              and yet simple technique that has been routinely used to isolate
              extremely rare DNA or RNA sequences with a function of interest
              (e.g. ligand-binding or catalysis) from an extraordinarily large
              population of single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules. Since the
              report of the first DNAzyme nearly ten years ago, hundreds of DNA
              sequences have been isolated in many research laboratories around
              the world to facilitate many chemical transformations of
              biological importance. In recent years, considerable efforts have
              been undertaken to assess a variety of DNAzymes for
              innovation-driven applications ranging from biosensing to gene
              regulation. This article provides a review on several key aspects
              of DNAzyme-related research. We will first review in vitro
              selection techniques used for DNAzyme creation as well as some
              DNAzymes created for a few representative chemical
              transformations. We will then discuss recent progresses in
              studying and developing DNAzymes as reporter molecules for
              detection-oriented applications, and as therapeutic agents to
              regulate gene expression at the RNA level. Future outlook on
              efforts aimed to bring the wonder of catalytic DNA from
              laboratory curiosity to real world application are also

               architectures may enable molecular decision-making on a level
               comparable to gene regulatory networks1,2. Non-enzymatic
               networks could in principle support neuromorphic architectures,
               and seminal proofs-of-principle have been reported3,4. However,
               leakages (that is, the unwanted release of species), as well as
               issues with sensitivity, speed, preparation and the lack of
               strong nonlinear responses, make the composition of layers
               delicate, and molecular classifications equivalent to a
               multilayer neural network remain elusive (for example, the
               partitioning of a concentration space into regions that cannot
               be linearly separated). Here we introduce DNA-encoded enzymatic
               neurons with tuneable weights and biases, and which are
               assembled in multilayer architectures to classify nonlinearly
               separable regions. We first leverage the sharp decision margin
               of a neuron to compute various majority functions on 10 bits. We
               then compose neurons into a two-layer network and synthetize a
               parametric family of rectangular functions on a microRNA input.
               Finally, we connect neural and logical computations into a
               hybrid circuit that recursively partitions a concentration plane
               according to a decision tree in cell-sized droplets. This
               computational power and extreme miniaturization open avenues to
               query and manage molecular systems with complex contents, such
               as liquid biopsies or DNA databases. Mimicking traditional
               digital neural networks with DNA-encoded `enzymatic' neurons
               overcomes issues with other chemical approaches, and could allow
               notable increases in miniaturization and molecular
               implementation of these AI models, with potential applications
               including DNA data storage or cancer diagnosis.",

               Multilayer, nonlinear, artificial neural networks are a powerful
               framework for implementing such functionality in a molecular
               system, as they are provably universal function approximators.

               We use a weight perturbation algorithm to train the neural
               network which uses a simple construction to directly approximate
               the loss derivatives required for training. We demonstrate the

               has been the development of experimental protocols for
               evaluation of Boolean logic circuits. These protocols for DNA
               circuits generally take as inputs single-stranded DNA molecules
               that encode Boolean values, and via a series of DNA
               hybridization reactions then release ssDNA strands to indicate
               Boolean output values. However, most of these DNA circuit
               protocols are use-once only, and there remains the major
               challenge of designing DNA circuits to be renewable for use with
               multiple sets of inputs. Prior proposed schemes to make DNA
               gates renewable suffered from multiple problems, including waste
               accumulation, signal restoration, noise tolerance, and limited
               scalable complexity. In this work, we propose a scalable design
               and in silico verifications for photoregulated renewable DNA
               seesaw logic circuits, which after processing a given set of
               inputs, can be repeatedly reset to reliably process other
               distinct inputs. To achieve renewability, specific toeholds in
               the system are labeled with photoresponsive molecules such as
               azobenzene to modulate the effective rate constants of
               toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reactions. Our
               proposed design strategy of leveraging the collective effect of
               TMSD and azobenzene-mediated dehybridization may provide new

               DNA hybridizations in complex and scalable reaction networks
               efficiently and economically. Various devices such as molecular
               walkers and motors could potentially be engineered reusable, be

              been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics,
              along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic
              DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems
              by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into
              a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we
              built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing
              that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for
              complex chemical dynamics and that autonomous molecular systems
              can be designed via molecular programming languages.",

                   approach that helps improve the generalization capability of

  abstract      = "To better understand and improve the behavior of neural
                   networks, a recent line of works bridged the connection
                   between ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and deep
                   neural networks (DNNs). The connections are made in two
                   folds: (1) View DNN as ODE discretization; (2) View the
                   training of DNN as solving an optimal control problem. The
                   former connection motivates people either to design neural
                   architectures based on ODE discretization schemes or to
                   replace DNN by a continuous model characterized by ODEs.
                   Several works demonstrated distinct advantages of using a
                   continuous model instead of traditional DNN in some specific
                   applications. The latter connection is inspiring. Based on
                   Pontryagin's maximum principle, which is popular in the
                   optimal control literature, some developed new optimization
                   methods for training neural networks and some developed
                   algorithms to train the infinite-deep continuous model with
                   low memory-cost. This paper is organized as follows: In
                   Section 2, the relation between neural architecture and ODE
                   discretization is introduced. Some architectures are not
                   motivated by ODE, but they are later found to be associated
                   with some specific discretization schemes. Some
                   architectures are designed based on ODE discretization and
                   expected to achieve some special properties. Section 3
                   formulates the optimization problem where a traditional
                   neural network is replaced by a continuous model (ODE). The
                   formulated optimization problem is an optimal control
                   problem. Therefore, two different types of controls will
                   also be discussed in this section. In Section 4, we will
                   discuss how we can utilize the optimization methods that are
                   popular in optimal control literature to help the training
                   of machine learning problems. Finally, two applications of
                   using a continuous model will be shown in Section 5 and 6 to
                   demonstrate some of its advantages over traditional neural
                   networks.",

               numerous machine learning tasks. However, general guidance to
               network architecture design is still missing. In our work, we
               bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential
               equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet,
               PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different
               numerical discretizations of differential equations. This
               finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of
               effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich
               knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and
               potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we
               propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which
               is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary
               differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective
               structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In
               particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e.
               the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet
               and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy
               than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with
               comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on
               both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly
               compress (>50\%) the original networks while maintaining a
               similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using
               the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last
               but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic
               control and noise injection in the training process which helps
               to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by
               relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic
               system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks
               with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced
               stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant
               improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.",

                   non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented
                   by skip connections from the block input to each of the

               machine learning, e.g. classification of text or images. While
               often offering superior results over traditional techniques and
               successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep
               architectures are known to be challenging to design and train
               such that they generalize well to new data. Critical issues with
               deep architectures are numerical instabilities in
               derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding
               or vanishing gradients. In this paper, we propose new forward
               propagation techniques inspired by systems of ordinary
               differential equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and
               lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep

               deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear

               and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new

              prospects for coupling drug delivery to sensors and implants.
              Micro- and nanotechnologies are enabling the design of novel
              methods such as radio-frequency addressing of individual
              molecules or the suppression of immune response to a release

              scale of the devices with the quantities of drugs that are
              clinically necessary, the requirement for more stable sensor

  abstract = "DNA aptamers are short strands that have high binding affinity
              for a target protein that can be used as triggers for releasing
              cargo from delivery vehicles. Douglas et al. (p. 831) used this
              strategy to design DNA origami ``nanorobots''---complex shaped
              structures created by manipulating a long DNA strand through
              binding with shorter ``staple'' strands---that could deliver
              payloads such as gold nanoparticles or fluorescently labeled
              antibody fragments. These nanorobots were designed to open in
              response to specific cell-surface proteins, releasing molecules
              that triggered cell signaling. Cargoes stored in folded DNA
              origami are released when aptamers in the structure bind target
              protein molecules. We describe an autonomous DNA nanorobot
              capable of transporting molecular payloads to cells, sensing cell
              surface inputs for conditional, triggered activation, and
              reconfiguring its structure for payload delivery. The device can
              be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized
              fashion and is controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate,
              enabling it to respond to a wide array of cues. We implemented
              several different logical AND gates and demonstrate their
              efficacy in selective regulation of nanorobot function. As a
              proof of principle, nanorobots loaded with combinations of
              antibody fragments were used in two different types of
              cell-signaling stimulation in tissue culture. Our prototype could
              inspire new designs with different selectivities and biologically
              active payloads for cell-targeting tasks.",

               matter at the nanometre to micron scale, with potential
               applications in high-precision organisation and positioning of
               molecular components. However, the ability to program DNA-only
               self-organisation beyond the microscopic scale is currently
               lacking. In this paper we propose a computational method for
               programming spatial organisation of DNA at the centimetre scale,
               by means of DNA strand displacement reaction diffusion systems.
               We use this method to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of an
               autocatalytic system, a predator-prey oscillator and a
               two-species consensus network. We find that both autocatalytic
               and oscillating systems can support travelling waves across
               centimetre distances, and that consensus in a spatial context
               results in the spontaneous formation of distinct spatial
               domains, in which one species is completely eliminated.
               Together, our results suggest that programmed spatial
               self-organisation of DNA, through a reaction diffusion
               mechanism, is achievable with current DNA strand displacement
               technology.",
