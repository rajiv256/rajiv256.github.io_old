One of the math concepts that continue to confound me are that of the *supremum* and *infimum*. Why do we have to complicate math discourse when we have the conventional *maxima* and *minima* that have been adsorbed into the minds of every high schooler ever [@hardy1992mathematician]? Is it because mathematicians are inherently elitist, egotistical, painfully do-hard blue-bloods? Well, no.

# Set theoretic definition

Both the supremum and infimum talk about a boundary condition. An explicitly vanilla definition is as follows. Let's say both of them are defined on a bounded set $\mathcal{A}$.

**Supremum**. This is the minimum of all possible upper bounds. Note that there can be many upper bounds for a given set.

**Infimum**. This is the maximum of all possible minimums. Again there can be many minimums for a given bounded set.

For example, consider the set in $\mathcal{Z}$, $\mathcal{A} = \{5, 10, 15\}$. Its upper bounds are $15, 16, ... \infty$ and its lower bounds are $-\infty, ..., 3, 4, 5$. (Note that the equality holds). In this case, the supremum (minimum of the upper bounds) is $15$ and the infimum (maximum of the lower bounds) is $5$.
